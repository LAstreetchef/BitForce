Response: {
  "status": "found/not_found",
  "breach_count": 3,
  "breaches": [
    {"name": "Adobe", "date": "2013-10-04", "data_classes": ["Email", "Password"]},
    # ... more breaches
  ],
  "risk_level": "medium",
  "recommendations": ["Change passwords", "Enable 2FA"]
}
```

1. Create backend endpoint for breach checking
2. Design and implement frontend interface
3. Add product to /products page
4. Test with sample emails
5. Add privacy disclaimers
6. Create upsell flow for monthly monitoring

**Timeline:** MVP in 2-3 days

**Deliverables:**
1. Fully functional breach checking tool
2. New product listing on /products page
3. Backend API endpoint
4. Mobile-responsive interface
5. Privacy-compliant data handling
6. Upsell path to premium monitoring

**Testing:** Use test emails like "test@example.com" or real breach-checking services to verify API integration works correctly.
