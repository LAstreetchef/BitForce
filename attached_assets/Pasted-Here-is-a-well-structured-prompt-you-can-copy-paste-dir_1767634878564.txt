Here is a well-structured prompt you can copy-paste directly into Replit (e.g. when creating a new Replit → choose HTML, CSS, JS template) or into an AI code generation tool inside Replit to build/improve the application:

```text
Create a complete, modern single-page web application in Replit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Bootstrap 5) for a company called "Digital Intelligence Marketing".

The purpose of the app is for brand ambassadors to sign up new customers for various home and digital services.

Design goals:
- Clean, professional, modern look and feel
- Use a blue primary color scheme (#007bff primary, light backgrounds, white cards)
- Include a nice header with company logo placeholder (use a simple text logo or img tag with src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x80/007bff/ffffff?text=EveryBit")
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

Main features to implement:

1. Customer Information Form (top section)
   - Fields: Full Name, Email, Phone, Home Address, Interests/Needs (textarea)
   - Big blue "Suggest Services" button that triggers AI-like service suggestions

2. AI-Powered Service Suggestions
   - When user clicks "Suggest Services", analyze the Interests/Needs textarea
   - Use simple JavaScript keyword matching to suggest relevant services
   - Display suggested services in a nice list or cards (clickable to open details)

3. Current Services Grid
   - Display all available services as responsive cards (3 per row on desktop)
   - Services list:
     - Digitizing Photos & Videos
     - Home AI Assistance
     - Home Digital Services (alarms, cameras, internet, website creation)
     - Roof Installation & Repair
     - Driveway Services
     - Plumbing Services
     - General Home Improvement Assistance
     - Mortgage & Financing Solutions
     - Custom / Other Services
   - Each card should be clickable and open a Bootstrap modal

4. Service Detail Modal
   - When clicking any service (from suggestions or main list):
     - Show modal with service name as title
     - List of 3–5 helpful questions the ambassador should ask the customer
     - Sales feedback/talking points to help close the sale
     - Nice formatting (bullet points, bold text)

5. Premium Membership Tier Section (bottom)
   - Attractive card or section with heading "Premium Membership"
   - Benefits list:
     - Periodic professional home visits
     - Personal AI-powered webpage (we create & maintain for you)
     - Priority access to all services
     - Exclusive offers on popular products
   - Big green "Sign Up for Membership" button (just alert() for now)

Technical requirements:
- Use Bootstrap 5 CDN (css + js bundle)
- Use only vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks like React/Vue)
- Put all services data in a JavaScript array of objects (name, questions array, feedback string)
- Make the suggestion logic case-insensitive and match multiple keywords
- Add subtle hover effects on service cards
- Make sure the whole page is scrollable and looks good on mobile

Bonus (if you have time):
- Add a simple loading spinner when "Suggest Services" is clicked (fake 800ms delay)
- Add basic form validation (name, email required)
- Make the "Sign Up" buttons show a success alert with customer name

Please generate the complete code in one file (index.html) with embedded <style> and <script> tags.
Use nice spacing, comments, and make the code easy to extend later.
```

You can paste this prompt directly into Replit's AI code generator (if available), or into ChatGPT/Claude/Grok/etc. while working in Replit, or simply use it as a detailed specification for manual development.

Let me know if you'd like a shorter version, more detailed version, or one focused on specific parts (e.g. only the suggestion logic)!
