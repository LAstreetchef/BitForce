Looking at your options and the purpose (ambassador tool for customer conversations), here's my analysis and suggested naming structure:

## **Recommended Names:**

### **Primary Tool Name:**
**"Security Exposure Check"** or **"Data Breach Checker"**

### **For Ambassador Use:**
**"Trust Builder Scanner"** or **"Security Conversation Starter"**

---

## **Why These Work Better:**

**"Security Exposure Check"** is:
- Clear and professional
- Sounds like a medical check-up (familiar analogy)
- Non-technical customers understand "exposure"
- Action-oriented ("check" implies something to do)

**"Data Breach Checker"** is:
- Direct and specific
- Uses common terminology ("data breach" is widely understood)
- Creates urgency without being alarmist

## **Complete Structure Suggestion:**

```
🔐 **SECURITY CHECK TOOL** (Main Header)

**Quick Security Audit** (Subtitle)
"Check your digital exposure in 60 seconds"

**Three-Step Check:**
1. **Email Breach Scan** (Instead of "Digital Footprint Scanner")
   "See if your email appears in known data breaches"
   
2. **Password Exposure Check** (Instead of "Password Checker")
   "Discover if your passwords have been compromised"
   
3. **Security Score & Recommendations** (Action-oriented)
   "Get your personal security score and improvement tips"
```

## **For Your Ambassador Portal Specifically:**

**"Customer Security Auditor"**
or
**"Trust Builder: Security Check"**

**Ambassador-facing description:**
```
**Tool Name:** Customer Security Auditor
**Purpose:** Quickly demonstrate security risks during conversations
**Usage:** 3-minute check that shows real exposure risks
**Outcome:** Natural lead-in to security service discussions
```

---

## **Best Option for Conversion:**
**"Free Security Risk Assessment"**

This works because:
1. **"Free"** attracts attention
2. **"Security Risk"** creates legitimate concern
3. **"Assessment"** sounds professional and thorough
4. It's a familiar business term (like "free consultation")

---

## **My Top Recommendation:**

**"Security Risk Check"** with the ambassador label:
**"🚨 Conversation Starter: Security Risk Check"**

**Why:**
- Short and memorable
- Creates appropriate concern level
- Works in both professional and casual conversations
- "Check" is low-commitment (not a "scan" or "audit" which sounds intensive)
- Ambassadors can say: "Can I show you a quick security risk check?"
