# **Local Lead Finder Tool - Replit Agent Prompt**

```markdown
**TASK:** Create a "Local Lead Finder" tool that scans a geo-fenced area for potential leads by analyzing local online resources, then presents them for ambassadors to pursue with BitForce marketing materials.

**PROJECT NAME:** "BitForce Lead Scout"
**TAGLINE:** "Find local opportunities in minutes, not days"

**CORE FUNCTIONALITY:**
User inputs: Address or ZIP code → System defines search radius → Scans local sources → Returns categorized leads → Allows saving/exporting → Integration with marketing materials

**INPUT PARAMETERS:**

1. **Location Input:**
   - Address, City, ZIP Code, or Coordinates
   - Search radius selector: 1mi, 5mi, 10mi, 25mi, custom

2. **Lead Criteria:**
   - Business type filters (small business, startups, retail, services, etc.)
   - Persona filters (entrepreneurs, tech-savvy individuals, security-conscious)
   - Date filters (recent mentions, new businesses, recent events)

**GEO-FENCING ENGINE:**

```javascript
// Radius calculation and bounding box
function createGeoFence(center, radiusMiles) {
  const earthRadius = 3959; // miles
  const latR = radiusMiles / earthRadius;
  const lngR = latR / Math.cos(center.lat * Math.PI / 180);
  
  return {
    minLat: center.lat - (latR * 180 / Math.PI),
    maxLat: center.lat + (latR * 180 / Math.PI),
    minLng: center.lng - (lngR * 180 / Math.PI),
    maxLng: center.lng + (lngR * 180 / Math.PI)
  };
}
```

**LEAD SCORING ALGORITHM:**

```python
class LeadScorer:
    def calculate_score(self, lead_data):
        score = 0
        
        # Business type scoring
        if lead_data['type'] in ['tech', 'consulting', 'digital']: score += 30
        elif lead_data['type'] in ['retail', 'service']: score += 20
        else: score += 10
        
        # Online presence scoring
        if lead_data['has_website']: score += 20
        if lead_data['has_social']: score += 15
        if lead_data['recent_news']: score += 25  # Recently in news
        
        # Size indicators
        if lead_data['employee_count'] > 10: score += 15
        if lead_data['revenue_indicator'] == 'growing': score += 20
        
        # Contact availability
        if lead_data['has_email']: score += 10
        if lead_data['has_phone']: score += 5
        
        return min(100, score)  # Cap at 100
```

**FRONTEND DISPLAY DASHBOARD:**

**1. Map Visualization:**
- Interactive Google Maps/Leaflet.js map
- Lead markers color-coded by score (red=high, yellow=medium, green=low)
- Cluster markers for dense areas
- Click markers for lead details

**2. Lead List View:**
```html
<div class="lead-card" data-score="85">
  <div class="lead-header">
    <span class="score-badge">85% Match</span>
    <h3>Digital Solutions LLC</h3>
    <span class="distance">1.2 miles away</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="lead-details">
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> IT Consulting</p>
    <p><strong>Found On:</strong> Chamber of Commerce, Google Business</p>
    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> contact@digitalsolutions.com | (555) 123-4567</p>
    <p><strong>Why they're a good fit:</strong> Recently expanded team, tech-focused</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="lead-actions">
    <button class="save-lead" data-id="lead123">💾 Save Lead</button>
    <button class="send-materials" data-id="lead123">📨 Send Marketing Kit</button>
    <button class="view-details" data-id="lead123">🔍 Details</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

**3. Filters & Sorting:**
- Sort by: Score, Distance, Business Size, Recent Activity
- Filter by: Industry, Employee Count, Revenue Indicator
- Search within results

**INTEGRATION WITH MARKETING MATERIALS:**

**One-Click Marketing Distribution:**
```javascript
// Integrated marketing actions
const marketingActions = {
  sendExplainer: function(leadId) {
    // Auto-generate personalized email with /explainer link
    const email = generateEmail({
      template: 'intro',
      link: '/explainer',
      personalization: leadData[leadId]
    });
    return email;
  },
  
  sendWhyBitForce: function(leadId) {
    // Send /why-bitforce page with personalized intro
    return generateEmail({
      template: 'value-proposition',
      link: '/why-bitforce',
      painPoints: analyzePainPoints(leadData[leadId])
    });
  },
  
  scheduleFollowup: function(leadId) {
    // Add to ambassador's follow-up calendar
    calendar.schedule({
      lead: leadId,
      action: 'call',
      date: '3 days from now',
      notes: 'Discuss BitForce solutions for ' + leadData[leadId].name
    });
  }
};
```

**BACKEND ARCHITECTURE:**

**1. Scraping Engine:**
```python
class LocalLeadScraper:
    def __init__(self, location, radius):
        self.location = location
        self.radius = radius
        self.results = []
    
    def scrape_source(self, source_type):
        if source_type == 'google_business':
            return self.scrape_google_places()
        elif source_type == 'yelp':
            return self.scrape_yelp()
        elif source_type == 'government':
            return self.scrape_government_sites()
        # ... additional sources
    
    def deduplicate_leads(self):
        # Merge duplicates from different sources
        pass
    
    def enrich_lead_data(self, lead):
        # Add additional data from other sources
        pass
```

**2. Data Processing Pipeline:**
```
Input Location → Geo-fencing → Source Scraping (Parallel) → 
Data Cleaning → Lead Scoring → Deduplication → 
Enrichment → Storage → Display
```

**3. Rate Limiting & Compliance:**
- Respect robots.txt for each site
- Implement delays between requests (1-2 seconds)
- User-agent rotation if scraping
- API key management for paid services
- Data privacy compliance (store only business/public data)

**AMBASSADOR WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:**

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. Ambassador enters target area
2. System scans and returns leads in 2-5 minutes
3. Ambassador reviews, saves promising leads
4. Ambassador selects marketing materials to send
5. System tracks outreach and responses
6. Ambassador follows up based on engagement

**Lead Management Features:**
- **Save to CRM:** One-click save to ambassador's lead list
- **Notes:** Add personal notes to each lead
- **Status Tracking:** New → Contacted → Interested → Client
- **Activity Log:** Track all interactions
- **Export Options:** CSV, PDF lead sheets

**PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:**

**Caching Strategy:**
```javascript
// Cache results by location to avoid repeated scraping
const cacheKey = `leads_${location}_${radius}_${timestamp}`;
if (cache.has(cacheKey)) {
  return cache.get(cacheKey);
} else {
  const results = await scrapeFreshData();
  cache.set(cacheKey, results, { ttl: 86400 }); // 24 hours
  return results;
}
```

**Progressive Loading:**
- Show initial results in 30 seconds
- Continue scraping in background
- Update UI as new leads found
- Allow ambassador to work with partial results

**TECHNICAL STACK:**

**Frontend:**

- Time saved vs manual research

**ALTERNATIVE SIMPLIFIED VERSION:**
If full implementation is too complex, start with:

```markdown
**Minimal Viable Product:**
1. Google Places API integration only
2. Basic list of businesses in radius
3. Export to CSV function
4. Manual email template with links

**Progressive Enhancement:**
- Add one data source per iteration
- Improve scoring over time
- Add features based on ambassador feedback
```

This tool will empower BitForce ambassadors to efficiently find and engage with local prospects, dramatically increasing their outreach effectiveness while saving hours of manual research time.
```

**Additional note for Replit Agent:** Given the complexity of this tool, consider starting with a simplified MVP that uses just Google Places API and manual export, then progressively add features based on user feedback and performance. The scraping components should be implemented carefully to avoid rate limiting and legal issues.
